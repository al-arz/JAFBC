Just Another Flappy Bird Clone made as a job interview test task. Took a couple of days (frustratingly long time), since I'm not particularly familiar with phaser/ts.

I was focusing mostly on 'getting the damn thing to work', so the code is of questionable quality.

Key requirements were:

* Endlessly generated tubes
* Game-over screen
    * Current score
    * Best score
    * Restart button
